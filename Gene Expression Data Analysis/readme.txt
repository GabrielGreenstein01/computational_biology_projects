Using a dataset on Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE25628), we compare expression assays from healthy controls and endometriosis patients. We first implement a KNN algorithm to classify each sample as disease or normal using the gene expression values. By implementing a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we identify gene sets that are significantly enriched using pathways from the KEGG database.
